        <description># PHPStorm
PhpStorm is built on top of the open-source IntelliJ Platform, which we've been developing and perfecting for over 15 years. Enjoy the fine-tuned, highly customizable experience it provides to fit your development workflow.
# FEATURES
## Intelligent coding assistance
PhpStorm is a PHP IDE that actually 'gets' your code. It supports PHP 5.3/5.4/5.5/5.6/7.0/7.1, provides on-the-fly error prevention, best autocompletion &amp; code refactoring, zero config debugging, and an extended HTML, CSS, and JavaScript editor.
#### Smart PHP Code Editor
The IDE provides smart code completion, syntax highlighting, extended code formatting config, on-the-fly error checking, code folding, supports language mixtures and more. Automated refactorings that treat your code with care, helping to make global project settings easily and safely.
#### Code Quality Analysis
Hundreds of code inspections verify your code as you type and inspect the whole project for possible errors or code smells. Quick-fixes for most inspections make it easy to fix or improve the code instantly. Alt+Enter shows appropriate options for each inspection.
#### Easy Code Navigation &amp; Search
PhpStorm helps you get around your code more efficiently and save time when working with large projects. Jump to a method, function or variable definition in just one click, or search for its usages.

## Debugging, Testing and Profiling
#### Debugging
Zero-config debugging makes it really easy to debug your PHP applications. Besides, PhpStorm provides numerous options for debugging your PHP code with Visual Debugger, so you can: inspect variables and user-defined watches, set breakpoints and evaluate an expression in runtime, debug remote applications, debug a page in multiple sessions simultaneously, and more.
#### Testing
You can develop PHPUnit tests right in PhpStorm and run them instantly from a directory, file or class, by using the context menu options. Code Coverage from PHPUnit shows how much of your code is covered with tests.
#### Profiling
You can profile your applications with Xdebug or Zend Debugger and check aggregated reports in PhpStorm.
